# What's important?

- **Relatability**  
Relatability - unlocks the potential.   
"They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.", - https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/relatability  
Being able to relate to others is the best gift I have unpacked in this world so far. Products start to sell, ideas start to flow, river and trees start to teach.

- **Balance**  
Health, Career/Skills/Materialism, Family. Health, Career/Skills/Materialism. Black, White.  
Perfectionism does not help much - you can't make everything being 100% perfect. Time is limited, money - limited, Earth resources - limited. There are boundries everywhere and overtaking anything by 100% is too selfish. I know it, I have tested it in various ways, including this way: https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/WorldSimulation

- **Skills**  
$ x 40 = paycheck. That's worong! It's SKILL x TIME = income.  
Become the best in the world at something, anything. And you'll experience. Think of your gifts, talents, and go for it. This may help you a bit on the journey: https://selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite-2-for-1-special

- **Assets**  
Having lots of money, code, or whatever - pointless. Invest your energy in obtaining/creating assets - wealth-generating "machines".  

- **Cultural memory**  
In case you die, you are dead. Your skills, IQ level, electronics, cars, houses, - all of that - you loose it all. A person who had near-death experience may confirm this, I know. Therefore, investing into memory of others is much more sustainable compared to investing into own head.
