## Targeted user profile - you?

I can't believe it takes soooo much effort to define a profile of users I would like to target my energy towards in life.  
I strongly believe we are all good people in general, but not all of us have been lucky enough to stay such for a life-long period.  
Therefore, it's tough to describe you for targeting purpose now (I still believe in everyone of all).  

There are many approaches on how to find you.  
For example, I did many personality tests in order to understand myself and so describe you as "a like-minded person".  
However, this kind of approach may be good for a team member in life to find, but not for a customer to find. 

Yes, my **first** targeted user profile should be my customer - the one with whom sharing "win-win" is possible.  
To be precise, it's the one who accepts the specifics I (may) have to offer and returns the value which I (may) know how to exchange in public.  

When it comes to **public**, it's a hard matter to deal with again.  
Why? The question is a very practical one - do I need to always be paid with "win" which is exchangable everywhere anytime?  
And the ansswer is - not really. I need just a "win" I may exchange with the part of public I feel safe with enough. It seems I want to self-realize with the most vital ones only.   

### Safety  

It's a paradox we get into here - the more you afraid for something in life the more universal "win" you want to ask for in return.  
In other words, the lack of confidence generates the wish for a society-wide recognision of wealth,  

The question is - what am I afraid of in life?  
It's a hard question again due to the nature of our being - I am a body, a mind, a soul. Fear is a cross-layer phenomenon.  

However, if I define and finally conquer the fears I have in each of the layer then I start to act with no need to receive the "win" back.
It seems the act of donation is the act of a fearless being.  

You may think (because I thought so) donation will make you fearless.  
However, this may most likely be considered as a logical falacity - A leading to B is not neccesseraly the same as B leading to A.  

It seems logic don't have a precise answer to donation results to fearlessnes.  
The only thing what is left when it comes to donation leading to fearlessness - to believe.  

So, the next question to myself is - how much fear do I want to have in my life?  
The answer to the question determine how widely recognizible "win" I want to receive after letting my customer win with my help.  

I should probably define a circle of poeple who would compensate (or even better - heal) my weaknesses in exchange to the "win".  
A smart person once said the target groups should contain 100 members.  

Therefore, it seems I should make a list of fears (which will correspond to my weaknesses) and then cover it all up by 100 entities.  
And that will be my "business plan" - to look for customers (i.e. assets) posesing a treatment for my weaknesses.  

#### My bucket list

| Fear                    | Remedy        | Entity posesing the remedy to which I may help to win  |
| ----------------------- |:-------------:| ------------------------------------------------------:|
| Making this list public | ?             | ?                                                      |

TBD
