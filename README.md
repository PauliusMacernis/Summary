# What's important?

- **Relatability**  
Relatability - unlocks potential.  
"They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.", - https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/relatability  
Being able to relate to others is the best gift I have unpacked in this world so far. Products start to sell, ideas start to flow, rivers and trees start to teach.

- **Balance**  
Health, Career/Skills/Materialism, Family. Health, Career/Skills/Materialism. Black, White.  
Perfectionism does not help much - you can't make everything 100% perfect. Time is limited, money - limited, Earth resources - limited. There are boundaries everywhere and overtaking anything by 100% is too selfish. I know it, I have tested it in various ways, including this way: [https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/WorldSimulation](https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/WorldSimulation)  

- **Skills**  
$ x 40 = paycheck. That's wrong! It's SKILL x TIME = income.  
Become the best in the world at something, anything. And you'll experience it. Think of your gifts, talents, and go for it. This may help you a bit on the journey: [https://selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite-2-for-1-special](https://selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite-2-for-1-special) (I am working on Past authoring for now, I know the exercise is amazing!)

- **Assets**  
Striving for lots of money, code, or whatever - pointless. In case you do not agree - you'll eventually stop by yourself after the stage of burnout will come. Invest your energy in obtaining/creating assets - energy/wealth-generating "machines", and not just writing lines of code and buying stuff after each salary.  

- **Diversification**  
Things you put into one place have the property of easily disappearing. Things you place all over - has the property of staying for much longer. The decision is simple, it is - store things you want to lose in one pocket, and store things you want to save in as many pockets as you are able to. Less (in one pocket) is more (in general).  

- **Cultural memory**  
In case you die, you are dead. Your skills, IQ level, electronics, cars, houses, - all of that - you lose it all. A person who had a near-death experience may confirm this, I know. Therefore, investing into the memory of others is much more sustainable compared to investing into your own head.  

- **Say truth**
Even if it's very very uncomfortable, do #seekdiscomfort. The purpose of the truth is to liberate - to release the tension. Tension accumulates in the circumstances where the truth is meant to be flowing but it is held for a reason of the attachments to the fixed image of the past. Release it, the reality is changing, be it once in two weeks, be it imperfect, but be honest and release the accumulated.
