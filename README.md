# What's important?

## Core values

- **Consistency**  
Or, as ITILv4 and many other methodologies put it - continuous improvement. Step by step. Small steps makes a great journey possible. Daily exercising, meditation, steps, cold shower, a page of the same book or whatever else. A good daily habit makes an atomically huge impact in the long run. “Which wolf will win?” The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”  

  - **Relatability**  
Relatability - unlocks potential.  
"They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.", - https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/relatability  
Being able to relate to others is the best gift I have unpacked in this world so far. Products start to sell, ideas start to flow, rivers and trees start to teach.  

  - **Knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques**  
$ x 40 = paycheck. That's wrong! It's SKILL x TIME = paycheck.  
Become the best in the world at something, anything. And you'll experience it. Think of your gifts, talents, and go for it. This may help you a bit on the journey: [https://selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite-2-for-1-special](https://selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite-2-for-1-special) (I am working on Past authoring for now, I know the exercise is amazing!). Just work towards finding out what are your talents, and build the skillset around these. As PMBOK states: knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques play the crucial role towards the success of any project (including the life project, I would add).

- **Balance**  
Health-Career/Skills/Materialism-Family, Health-Career/Skills/Materialism, Black-White.  
Perfectionism does not help much - you can't make everything 100% perfect. Time is limited, money - limited, Earth resources - limited. There are boundaries everywhere and overtaking anything by 100% is too selfish. I know it, I have tested it in various ways, including this way: [https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/WorldSimulation](https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/WorldSimulation)  

  - **Rest**  
A pause is the essential part of a music, play. Learn to stop just before burnout happens. Balance the load.    

  - **Vision**  
Ideas make no difference, a very strong idea called vision - makes the difference by fostering motivation of all. However, even with a very clear vision nothing happens if nothing gets done. Getting dirty for real is the part of success. You may not be perfect, but getting into doing something makes real progress - builds the reality for real. Balance between receiving and sending sparking thoughts.  

  - **Minimalism**  
Leave experiences in other memories, not just things you have bought. Leaving things after yourself someone have to take care of unwillingly is disrespect. We respect people and therefore having much of anything not in use is a waste of resources in general. For the things, if the item can be replaced in 20 minutes for less than $20, it’s probably not worth keeping around. Focus.   

  - **Mindfulness**  
Thinking about the future and envisioning it is ok. But there is no happy life if you don't live in the moment: see, hear, taste, feel... here and now. This includes avoiding checking the phone while in the meeting, skipping tv while eating, turning off the radio while thinking.  Sure, mindfulness is required. However, don't go too far - we don't want to experience so called sensory overload.  

- **Assets**  
Striving for lots of money, code, or whatever - pointless. In case you do not agree - you'll eventually stop by yourself after the stage of burnout will come. Invest your energy in obtaining/creating assets - energy/wealth-generating "machines", and not just writing lines of code and buying stuff after each salary.  

- **Diversification**  
Things you put into one place have the property of easily disappearing. Things you place all over - has the property of staying for much longer. The decision is simple, it is - store things you want to lose in one pocket, and store things you want to save in as many pockets as you are able to. Less (in one pocket) is more (in general).  

- **Cultural memory**  
In case you die, you are dead. Your skills, IQ level, electronics, cars, houses, - all of that - you lose it all. A person who had a near-death experience may confirm this, I know. Therefore, investing into the memory of others is much more sustainable compared to investing into your own head. The universal causal law by which good or bad actions determine the future modes of an individual's existence will tell if that's wrong.  

- **Say truth**  
Even if it's very very uncomfortable, do #seekdiscomfort. The purpose of the truth is to liberate - to release the tension. Tension accumulates in the circumstances where the truth is meant to be flowing but it is held for a reason of the attachments to the fixed image of the past. Release it, the reality is changing, be it once in two weeks, be it imperfect, but be honest and release the accumulated.  

- **Agreement**  
The most difficult part in the current world is to agree on a one specific thing and stick to it no matter what. You may think you control yourself by 100%, but you have weeknesses too. So you will definatelly (sorry for saying so..) break from time to time. When it comes to two or more people trying to agree on something, really anything - that's tough, and I do sometimes thing that such really long-term agreements are even close to impossible to have. Agreements relay on fostering motivation for the self and others, otherwise keeping up with the agreement is not happening well enough.  

- **Acceptance**  
You should believe in others. Even if they lie. Good listening with following arguments in the form of amaizing questions will make the truth prosper.  

- **Demo**  
Demo is important for others and for the self in order to invest further. Wanna buy a house in the forest? Try to live in such a reasonable demo period of your life. Wanna move out and establish a life abroad? Try working and living there for a while. Wanna show the product? Proof of concept as a demo is important too. Wanna buy this stuff for the credit? Try to arange the monthly payment for yourself for a demo period of time. Wanna pet? Try getting up a few times a day and get outside for a walk, rent one for a while, just do a demo. Wanna say the person X is worse than you? Try to meditate for an hour before. Sometimes a demo is enough. Some startups say 9 demos out of 10 results in failure in the long term. That's why we need demo so much.  

- **Thanks**  
Appreciation is important. That's the easiest thing you may give, it's a never ending resource you could possess over your lifetime. Sure, you have to be truthful and honest, otherwise that's just a "thank you" without the real meaning. It's sometimes easy, and sometimes very hard to trully appreciate a person, a pattern, or whatever else. However, that's just a challenge we face everyday - how to appreciate the mater in the life. Training everyday makes appreciation easier, and the life becomes more and more positive in general.   



## I am not perfect. 

But I know what's important. Life-long learning does not scare me, I enjoy the process.
